dedicated to pure analog HiFi  
no Class-D / no SMPS / no DSP / no Microcontroller ...   
Oldscool German THEL and ALBS Products are my reference  
each repo here features one of these vintage products (most of them modules for DIY Hifi)    

In future (bit by bit):  
- I will provide circuit diagrams and circuit boards (all in KiCad 6.x format) so that you are able to build yourself  
- I will design an provide more modern variants with 2-layer boards and SMD parts ... 

Each of the repos has it's own "Discussions" tab -> a small forum like area where we can discuss all this
